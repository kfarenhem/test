								<h2>Benefits of Sustainable Fashion</h2>
							</header>
								<p>The world has become more conscious about the environment
									than it ever was before, especially with there being drastic impacts.
									That is the reason why numerous industries have become eco-conscious.
									The same trend has been adopted by the fashion industry, especially with the
									introduction of eco-friendly clothing for women. Here is what you need to know
									about eco-friendly clothing for women and why they are important.</p>
									<p>If you look into the facts, you will find that the fashion industry has been
									largely responsible for a lot of chemical waste. Eco-fashion, on the other
									hand, uses materials such as hemp, cotton, tinsel, wool or silk to avoid any
									drastic impacts as shown previously. With everyone thinking green, it is
									important to choose eco-friendly clothes for women, especially for these
									benefits.</p>
									<p>First, since the materials are found naturally,
									the clothes are considerably inexpensive than their counterparts.
									Clothes made out of synthetic materials are very expensive since
									the materials have to be created in the first place. Therefore, as
									a consumer, you might find it hard to keep up with the costs. However,
									with the natural and eco-friendly materials, you can always count on cheap
									prices making the clothes affordable to anyone out there.</p>
									<p>Secondly, eco-friendly clothing has become very durable compared to
									synthetic clothes. Natural and organic materials are considered stronger
									and more durable. If possible, you can always visit a second-hand clothes
									shop and find out the fact on your own. Clothes made out of organic and
									eco-friendly materials can last many years without any damage and still looking good
									as new. Therefore, there is no need to spend a fortune buying new clothes, when the
									second-hand clothes are still as stylish as when they were first manufactured.</p>
									<p>Finally, eco-friendly clothing has numerous benefits to the environment,
									humans and animals. Take a good example where a lot of chemical waste is
									generated from factories that manufacture synthetic clothes.
									If the waste is dumped into the nearby rivers, people and animals
									with access to the water are exposed to various health hazards that might
									affect their day to day lives. On other hand, the manufacturing industries
									produce toxic fumes that pollute the air making it unbreathable. Organic
									clothing has all the benefits. You can count on there being no toxic waste
									from the production of these clothes. Therefore, if you want to be more eco-conscious,
									you can always try out the various eco-friendly clothing options and save the environment.</p>

						<h2>Costs of Fast Fashion</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The fashion industry is designed to make you feel out
								of style in a considerably short amount of time. Designers
								 pump out new styles on a weekly basis, with retailers like H&M,
								 Zara and Forever21 receiving daily shipments of new styles. Essentially,
								 being “on-trend” 24/7 is designed to be impossible.
								 Nowadays, it’s estimated that our fashion industry follows 52 micro-seasons rather than just 4.
								 “Fast fashion” itself refers a phenomenon whereby production processes are accelerated in order
								 to release new trends to the market as quickly and cheaply as possible.
								 Designer looks are pulled directly off the runway and mimicked by lower-end brands almost instantaneously.
								 From the perspective of retailers, fast fashion is beneficial as the constant flow of product encourages
								 customers to make frequent visits to the stores.</p>
								 <p>Aside from the fact that fast fashion can encourage a “throw-away”
									 or “disposable” culture among consumers, naturally it requires extremely
									 fast production. Consequently, retailers turn to impoverish countries where
									  the cost of labour is the cheapest. The conditions of these work environments
										are poor due to the lack of properly executed factory standards. Particularly,
										 these manufacturers have tight delivery deadlines which need to be met.
									 Research supports that many supplier factories force workers into overtime
									 to meet these disproportionately high production targets. Majority of
									 these workers earn less than living wage and are exposed to toxic chemicals
									 on the job. Unfortunately any genuine representation or unionization of these
									 workers is rare. There is also environmental aftermath to consider that is caused by low quality
									 production in fast fashion. A variety of chemicals like lead, formaldehyde,
									 pesticides, and carcinogens are woven into the fabrics we put on our bodies.
									 Run-off from factories finds its way back into the earth, now with increasing
									 amounts as demand rises. In addition to this, landfills are overflowing with unwanted
									 clothing.</p>
