					<h2>What is Sustainable Fashion?</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Sustainable fashion is a movement and
            process of fostering change to fashion products
            and the fashion system towards greater ecological integrity
            and social justice. Sustainable fashion concerns more than addressing
            fashion textiles or products. It comprises addressing the whole system
            of fashion.

						<h3>How Much Is It?</h3>
						<p>Sustainable clothing may seem more expensive than the average fast fashion clothing store such as H&M. However,
            the environmental costs deem to be way lower than those of big retail giants.

						<h3>Who Has it?</h3>
						<p> There are a plethora of eco-friendly clothing brands that
              you may already have in your closet. Here are a few:
            </p>
              <ul>

						<h3>Why Should I Care?</h3>
						<p>The fashion industry leaves behind a huge environmental footprint,
            from the pesticides used in growing cotton and the leached chemicals from
            the toxic dyes that went into that perfect shade of teal,
            to the landfill impact of clothes that wear out and the energy
            required to produce each piece. </p>

							<h2> Reduces Toxic Waste</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Clothes dyes are massively harmful to the
							environment and cotton clothing requires 1/3 of a pound
							of chemicals for a single shirt. That amount really adds up and
							is disastrous for our environment.</p>

							<h2>Higher Quality Clothing</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Buying organic clothes and purchasing timeless pieces
							will help to cut down on consumerism. This in turn reduces
							your carbon footprint and will save you money in the long term.</p>

						<header>
							<h2>Supporting Fair Trade</h2>
						</header>
						<p>By buying clothes labeled under the Fair Trade Act you have reassurance
							that the manufacturing process did not involve any sweatshops and that
							the working conditions of employees were safe. This helps you to support
							human rights while also protecting the environment.</p>

						<header>
							<h2>Supporting Animal Rights</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Clothes made of leather or fur require the
							deaths of many animals. For many people, the guilt of wearing
							these clothes is too much. By switching to cruelty free clothing
							you can rest assured that your fashion didn’t cause the death of another
							living being.</p>
