    <h1> What is Competitive Cheerleading?</h1>
  </header>
  <nav>
    Competitive cheerleading is when cheer squads compete against each other at a competition.
    At a typical cheerleading competition, teams perform a 2 and a half minute routine with music that
    includes stunts, jumps, tumbling. Teams are judged by a panel of cheerleading experts on
    difficulty and execution. The winner in each division gets a trophy and bragging rights.
    All types of cheerleading teams have the option to compete, but not all school-based
    cheerleading squadsre competitive. School teams perform routines with a cheer with signs,
    poms, and megaphones that showcase their sideline skills along with an entertainment section to music.
    On the other hand, all star cheerleading squads, who are not affiliated with a school, exist solely
    to compete. All star routines do not include a cheer since
    they don’t technically cheer for anyone, and their routines are all entertainment/music.
    Teams compete based on age and difficulty level (1-6, 6 being the most difficult).
    Either way, competing as a cheerleader is really challenging, athletic, and so much fun.
    If you want to become a competitive cheerleader,
    find out if your school has a cheer squad that competes or contact a local all star gym.
    Cheerleading is a great way to get involved with a sport, but does require a lot of
    hardwork and commitment.

    In Competitive Cheerleading, athletes are given to travel around the country to perfom routines, meet other athletes, and see new places that they other wise wouldn't.
    Varisty is the most common event, uniform, shoes, and merchandise provider. Many of cheerleading's rules and regulations are created by Varsity, essentially governing over cheerleading as a whole.

    Just as not everyone will be good at football or basketball, not everyone will be
    good at cheerleading. By the time a girl is old enough to get onto an all star
    squad (usually around age eight or nine), girls should have already been taking gymnastics
     for several years and have mastered several tumbling skills. While girls can learn these
     skills later, it's often more difficult. In addition to tumbling, there are a few other
     things a competitive cheerleader needs:
     <ul>
       <li>
         Excellent upper body strength: Cheerleaders must have good upper
         body strength both for remaining stiff and for performing stunts.
       </li>
       <li>
         Confidence: Cheerleaders must feel like they can perform a
          stunt, that they are able to do it and that they will not fail.
       </li>
       <li>
       Excellent physical conditioning: Cheerleaders have to be in good cardiovascular shape.
       It takes a lot of effort to dance, stunt, cheer and tumble to the beat of cheerleading music.
     </li>
     <li>
       Determination and commitment: Competitive cheerleading requires daily practice
       as well as off season practice and conditioning.
     </li>
     <li>
       Good sportsmanship: Competitive cheerleaders must work as a team. The old cliché "There is no I in team" is very appropriate.
     </li>
     </ul>
